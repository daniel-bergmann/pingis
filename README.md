www.pingis.is is a small photography project of mine. I enjoy taking photos, programming and play table tennis so why not combine it all? I decided to document the Icelandic table tennis community and post it on pingis for people to enjoy and use as they please. I also offer people the option to buy prints and it has become quite popular within the community. It has a sleek and simple design with simple scrolling usability. I tried to imitate instagram since people are used to that infinite scroll design functionality.

Everyone is welcome to use the tool and fork to the project.
